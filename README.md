Depth-First Search (DFS)
Grid visualization where you can set start, end, and wall cells manually.
Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Step-by-step sorting visualization through a text area.
Searching Algorithms
Linear Search
Binary Search
Displays each step with sorted array and checked elements.
Dynamic Programming
